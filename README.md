## Don Norman's Theory

### Seven Stages of Action
1. Forming the goal
    - Pretty self explanatory
1. Forming the itention
    - **Plan** to turn my goal into an intention to act
1. Specifying an action
    - **Specify** an action sequence
1. Executing an action
    - **Perform** this sequence
1. Perceiving the state of the world
    - **Perceive** the change
1. Interpreting the state of the world
    - **Interpret** the change
1. Evalutating the outcome
    - **Evaluate** the outcome

### The Gulf of Execution
The difference between intentions and allowable actions is the Gulf of Execution

*Ex. printing a document*
- **Failure to form an intention**
    - I didn't realize that I can print my document
- **Failure to forumlate an action sequence**
    - I don't know where to find the print button
- **Failure to execute the action**
    - Some other dialogue is open and preventing me from clicking buttons

####Gulf of Evaluation
The Gulf of Evaluation reflects the amount of effort that the person must exert to interpret the physical state of the system and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met.

*Ex. the default printer is wrong*
- **Failure to perceive the outcome**
    - I didn't notice the default printer in the dialogue
- **Failure to interpret the outcome**
    - I notice it but think it is the correct printer
- **Failure to evaluate the outcome**
    - I notice it is wrong but think it is a glitch

### Six Principles of Deisgn
1. **Visibility**
    - Users need to know their options and how to access them
1. **Feedback**
    - Every action needs a reaction. *Ex. sounds, animations, popup, etc.*
1. **Affordance**
    - The relationship between what something looks like and how it is used
1. **Mapping**
    - The relationship between control and effect. With good design, the controls should closely resemble what the effect. *Ex. the scroll bar represents where you are on the page*
1. **Constraints**
    - The limits to an interaction or interface. *Ex. screen size, an image peeking from the bottom of the page inviting users to scroll down*
1. **Consistency**
    - The same action needs to cause the same reaction. Every time.
